# API Reference 
### Comprehensive guide to the Learning App API endpoints'

## Welcome

The Learning App API allows developers to interact with courses, teachers, students, and tests within the platform. You can build API documentation using two methods: [OpenAPI](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/openapi/setup) or [MDX components](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/mdx/configuration). For this starter kit, we are utilizing the following OpenAPI specification.

## Authentication

All API endpoints require authentication via Bearer tokens, as defined in the specification file.

```json
"security": [
  {
    "bearerAuth": []
  }
]
```

### Example Authentication Header

When making requests to the API, include the following header:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <your-token>
```

## Key Features

- **Courses**: Manage course creation, updates, and deletion.
- **Teachers**: Add, modify, or delete teacher profiles.
- **Students**: Handle student data, including enrollment and details.
- **Tests**: Create and manage tests associated with specific courses.

### Example Endpoint

Hereâ€™s an example of how to fetch all courses:

```http
GET /courses
```

#### Response

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Introduction to Programming",
    "description": "Learn the basics of programming.",
    "teacherId": 1
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Advanced Mathematics",
    "description": "Dive into complex mathematical concepts.",
    "teacherId": 2
  }
]
```
